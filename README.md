# Hafsa — Data Science Portfolio

Hello — I’m Hafsa, a self-taught data scientist focusing on EDA, machine learning, and deploying simple ML apps. This repo contains 4 core projects designed to demonstrate end-to-end data work, deployment, and SQL analytics.

## Projects (quick links)
1. **Project 01 — Customer Churn (EDA & Model)** : project_01_churn_eda/
