# Ames Housing Price Estimator

This project is a machine learning application that predicts house prices using the **Ames Housing dataset**. It features a step-by-step Streamlit app where users can input property details like quality, size, amenities, and more to estimate the sale price.

Key highlights:  
- **Model:** XGBoost Regressor (log-transformed SalePrice)  
- **Performance:** RMSE ≈ 0.13 — a strong baseline;
-  “With an estimated 86–87% alignment to actual prices, the model delivers strong predictive perfomance further hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering could improve accuracy  
- **Data Exploration:** Comprehensive EDA to understand trends, correlations, and feature importance  
- **Interactive Interface:** Stepwise user input with live prediction and informative notes  
- **Purpose:** Portfolio-grade demonstration of ML modeling, preprocessing, and deployment  
- **Skills Applied:**  
- Python programming  
- Data manipulation with Pandas & NumPy  
- Data visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Regression modeling with XGBoost  
- Model evaluation (RMSE, feature importance)  
- Handling real-world datasets and preprocessing techniques
