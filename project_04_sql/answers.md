### Q1: Top 10 Products by Total Sales

**Insight:**
The highest revenue-generating products are expensive office equipment such as copiers,
binding machines, and conferencing systems. This indicates a B2B-focused sales model where
revenue is driven by low-volume but high-value items rather than frequent low-cost purchases.

### Q2: Top 10 Products by Quantity Sold

**Insight:**
High sales volume is driven by low-cost, frequently purchased office supplies.
This contrasts with revenue-based rankings (Query 1), which are dominated by expensive equipment.
Together, these analyses highlight a dual sales strategy:
- High-volume consumables for everyday demand
- High-value equipment for large, infrequent purchases
This insight can guide inventory planning and promotional focus.

### Q3: Sales by Region & Product Category

**Insight:**
Revenue distribution varies across regions. For instance, in the East region, Technology dominates,
while Furniture and Office Supplies also contribute significantly. In the West, Technology and Furniture
perform strongly, with Office Supplies slightly lower. Understanding these patterns helps with
targeted marketing, regional inventory planning, and identifying high-demand product categories
per region.

### Q4: Monthly Sales Trend

**Insight:**
Monthly sales data from 2014 to 2017 shows clear seasonal patterns and gradual growth over the years.
Some months, like November and December, consistently show higher sales, indicating peak demand periods.
Lower-sales months, such as February, suggest off-season periods. Understanding these trends can help
with inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and staffing, ensuring resources are allocated efficiently
during high-demand months.

### Q5: Total Profit by Customer Segment

**Insight:**
The Consumer segment generates the highest total profit, followed by Corporate and Home Office.

while maintaining relationships with Corporate and Home Office segments ensures balanced growth.

This indicates that the majority of revenue comes from the most commonly used shipping method,
while faster or premium shipping contributes less. Understanding shipping preferences helps optimize
logistics, cost management, and customer satisfaction.

### Q9: Rolling 3-Month Revenue

**Insight:**
The rolling 3-month revenue highlights short-term trends and seasonality in sales.  
By summing the current month with the previous two months, fluctuations are smoothed, making 
patterns like peak months (November-December) and slower months (February) more visible.  
This is useful for inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and cash flow management.

### Q10: Churn Proxy - Customers with No Purchases in Last 6 Months

**Insight:**

These customers are potential churn risks, and targeting them with campaigns could improve

special offers, and retention strategies.

California leads in total sales ($450,567.59) and has the highest number of customers (573), making it the **most important state for revenue generation**.

This analysis helps **target marketing, adjust pricing strategies, and optimize regional operations**.

### Q16: Bulk Orders (>10 Units per Customer)

Insight:
Most bulk orders are **office supplies** like binders, pens, and labels.  
High-value items like chairs and tables appear less often.

### Q17: Discount Analysis - Products with Highest Average Discounts

**Insight:**  
- Products like *Eureka Disposable Bags* and *GBC Plasticlear Binding Covers* have very high discounts (0.7–0.8), but low sales volume.  
Items with moderate discounts (0.6–0.65) like *Premier Elliptical Ring Binder* see better uptake, suggesting sweet-spot pricing works.  
Suggestion: Avoid extreme discounts on low-demand items; focus moderate discounts on products with consistent demand to boost sales without hurting profit.  
Consider monitoring high-ticket items separately to ensure discounts don’t erode margins excessively.

### Q18: Profit vs Discount Trends - High-Value Products

**Insight:**  
- High-value products like *Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier* and *Fellowes PB500 Electric Punch* generate substantial revenue even with moderate discounts, showing strong demand.  
- Some mid-tier items (e.g., *Plantronics CS510*, *Honeywell Enviracaire HEPA*) achieve decent profit at lower discounts, suggesting price sensitivity is moderate.  
- Suggestion: Maintain strategic discounts on high-demand, high-value items to drive volume without hurting margins.  
- Monitor low-profit items carefully; avoid over-discounting products like *Logitech Z-906 Speaker System* which have low margin despite sales.

### Q19: Customer Discount Sensitivity (Discount vs Profit)

**Insights:**
- Customers receiving **very high discounts (40–70%) are mostly loss-making**, even when their total sales look strong.
- **Negative profit is driven by over-discounting**, not by lack of demand.
- A **small number of customers stay profitable at ~30–35% discounts**, showing discounts can work if controlled.
- **Discounts beyond ~40% consistently destroy margin** and should trigger review or approval.
- Business should move toward **discount caps or customer-level pricing rules** instead of blanket discounts.

Furniture: Peaks in Mar & Jun; loss observed in Mar → review pricing/inventory.
Office Supplies: Steady with spikes Apr & Jun; dip in Jul → adjust stock/discounts.

Suggestion: Plan inventory & marketing according to seasonal peaks and address months with losses.
