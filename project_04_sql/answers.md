### Q1: Top 10 Products by Total Sales

**Insight:**
The highest revenue-generating products are expensive office equipment such as copiers,
binding machines, and conferencing systems. This indicates a B2B-focused sales model where
revenue is driven by low-volume but high-value items rather than frequent low-cost purchases.

### Q2: Top 10 Products by Quantity Sold

**Insight:**
High sales volume is driven by low-cost, frequently purchased office supplies.
This contrasts with revenue-based rankings (Query 1), which are dominated by expensive equipment.
Together, these analyses highlight a dual sales strategy:
- High-volume consumables for everyday demand
- High-value equipment for large, infrequent purchases
This insight can guide inventory planning and promotional focus.

### Q3: Sales by Region & Product Category

**Insight:**
Revenue distribution varies across regions. For instance, in the East region, Technology dominates,
while Furniture and Office Supplies also contribute significantly. In the West, Technology and Furniture
perform strongly, with Office Supplies slightly lower. Understanding these patterns helps with
targeted marketing, regional inventory planning, and identifying high-demand product categories
per region.

### Q4: Monthly Sales Trend

**Insight:**
Monthly sales data from 2014 to 2017 shows clear seasonal patterns and gradual growth over the years.
Some months, like November and December, consistently show higher sales, indicating peak demand periods.
Lower-sales months, such as February, suggest off-season periods. Understanding these trends can help
with inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and staffing, ensuring resources are allocated efficiently
during high-demand months.

### Q5: Total Profit by Customer Segment

**Insight:**
The Consumer segment generates the highest total profit, followed by Corporate and Home Office.
This indicates that individual consumers are the most valuable customers in terms of profitability.
Targeting marketing efforts and promotions toward the Consumer segment could further increase revenue,
while maintaining relationships with Corporate and Home Office segments ensures balanced growth.

### Q6: Top 10 Customers by Total Sales

**Insight:**
The top 10 customers contribute significantly to total revenue, with Sean Miller generating the highest sales.
Identifying these high-value customers helps focus personalized marketing, loyalty programs, and
relationship management. Maintaining and nurturing these relationships can maximize repeat business
and overall profitability.

### Q7: Customer Lifetime Value (Top 10 Customers)

**Insight:**
Tamara Chand, Raymond Buch, and others are top revenue-generating customers.  
Sean Miller remains the **highest-value customer**. Understanding top customers’ contribution
to overall revenue is crucial for prioritizing retention, personalized offers, and loyalty programs.

### Q8: Sales by Ship Mode

**Insight:**
Standard Class generates the highest total sales, followed by Second Class, First Class, and Same Day.
This indicates that the majority of revenue comes from the most commonly used shipping method,
while faster or premium shipping contributes less. Understanding shipping preferences helps optimize
logistics, cost management, and customer satisfaction.

### Q9: Rolling 3-Month Revenue

Insight:
The rolling 3-month revenue highlights short-term trends and seasonality in sales.  
By summing the current month with the previous two months, fluctuations are smoothed, making 
patterns like peak months (November-December) and slower months (February) more visible.  
This is useful for inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and cash flow management.

### Q10: Churn Proxy - Customers with No Purchases in Last 6 Months

Insight:
The query returned customers whose last purchase was **more than 6 months ago**.  
These customers are potential churn risks, and targeting them with campaigns could improve 
retention. Examples include Claire Gute (2017-01-26), Andrew Allen (2017-04-15), and Irene Maddox (2016-12-05).
